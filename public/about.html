  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>
    My name is Alex Sulce, and I am 20 years old. My hobbies are gaming, going for long walks, and riding my motorcycle with my
    friends. I also really enjoy learning new skills, and learning how to program has always been a dream I've had which now I finally
    built up the courage to start learning.
  </p>

    Before starting to learn about computer sciences, I worked with my father who owns a small construction firm. My goal was to learn
    my fathers job, while also taking a load of his shoulders since he liked working with a small team that he could trust, meaning he 
    didn't really take on workers to help himself. I was getting really good at the job, until one day I had a work related accident 
    resulting in me tearing my left Achille's tendon completely and being bed ridden for about 4 good months, and still recovering today,
    almost a full year after the accident. Thankfully, I had enrolled in a private school called IEK AKMI, with the goal of learning 
    programming and possibly pursuing a career of my own instead of "riding my father's coat tails".

    So far, I've learned entry level C and C++, along with some HTML and CSS. Out of the 3 classes, I have to admit that the one I had the
    least interest about was web development, since that is the one which had the slowest progress out of the 3. While I was able to make
    small games like Tic Tac Toe or Connect 4 in C and C++, I couldn't build anything intresting whit the tools I was learing in my web
    development class. That is until I finally met a fow programmers from abroad who were working as web developers
    and the department started growing on me. I decided I'll try learning the tools necessary for the job, so I signed up to Udemy and bought
    a course that begins from entry level html, and eases you into CSS, JS, Git Hub, and much more. I've used the course to built this website
    as you see it right now.

    This small page will be constantly updated to show out my progress, and I hope that if anyone reading this for any reason ever feels like
    they want to start web development, this page will give them the inspiration to start learning.
