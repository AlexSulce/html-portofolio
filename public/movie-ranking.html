<h3>Naruto</h3>

<p>
    Naruto is a show I used to watch all the time when I was younger because it used to air in the albanian channels.
    It is about a young ninja named Naruto (duh) who has a nine-tailed demon fox inside of him that rampaged through
    his village, and had to be sealed inside of him. The village hates him cause he houses the demon that claimed their
    loved ones lives, so he wants to become a strong ninja and the village leader in order for the people to love him.

<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>

<p>
    Hunter X Hunter is about a young light hearted and cheerful boy named Gon Freecs. Gon is from a small island where he 
    grew up with his aunt Mito, because his father left him in the village in order to pursue his career as a Hunter. Hunters
    are physically gifted individuals who are part of the Hunter organization, which selects these individuals through brutal
    challenges, and embarks said members on dangerous missions. We see Gons journey through the Hunter's exam, and the friendships 
    he makes along the way.
